# BizcardX_ExtractingBussinessCarDataByOCR
This project will build a Streamlit application that uses easyOCR to extract information from business cards. The extracted information will be saved to a database and displayed in a user-friendly GUI. 

The project is to develop a Streamlit application that uses easyOCR to extract information from business cards. Users can upload an image of a business card, and the application will extract the company name, cardholder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin code. 

The extracted information will be displayed in a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). Users can save the extracted information to a database, along with the uploaded business card image. The database will be able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information. 

The final application will have a simple and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information. 

The extracted information will be displayed in a clean and organized manner, and users can easily add it to the database with the click of a button.
